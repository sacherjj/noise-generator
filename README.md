# noise-generator
Simple Rust CLI for playing with noise color generation.

A comment by Jon Gjengset on his [2026 Q&A video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_zp82fYrGw) made me think about noise color generation in Rust.

I put together a quick CLI to play with white, pink, blue, brown, and gray noise.

I still think his coding for brown noise would be interesting. 
I'm not happy with what I have for brown and gray noise on here.
